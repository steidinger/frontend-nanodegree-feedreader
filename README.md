# Project Overview

This project contains a web-based RSS feed reader and its test suite. 

## Getting Started

You should clone this repository into a directory of your choice. Once you have the files on your
computer, open the project's ```index.html``` to start the application. The tests run automatically
when you start the application. The results of the tests are displayed at the bottom of the page under 
the heading **Jasmine**.

If all tests pass you should see the message **0 failures** on a green background. If one or more tests
fail the message will show the number of failed tests on a red background.
